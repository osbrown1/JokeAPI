GOAL: Funcionality that allows the user to create jokes using the joke API.

Concerns:
-why is 'generate' not defined?



Button is operational, requires generateJoke()
We do get error response 'There was an error accessing the thing for default: undefined'

async function generateJoke(generate = 'default') { error code: 'There was an error accessing the thing for default: undefined'

async function generateJoke(generate) { error code: 'There was an error accessing the thing for undefined: undefined'
